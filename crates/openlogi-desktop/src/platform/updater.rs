//! Opt-in update check, backed by the [`gpui_updater`] crate.
//!
//! A single shared [`Updater`] entity is installed at GPUI startup via
//! [`install`] and published as a [`SharedUpdater`] global. When
//! [`AppSettings::check_for_updates`] is enabled, exactly one check runs on
//! launch; the result is surfaced in Settings → Updates. With
//! [`AppSettings::auto_install_updates`] also on, a found update downloads and
//! stages in the background (applied on next restart); otherwise no download,
//! no polling.
//!
//! The manual "Check for Updates" button in Settings → Updates works regardless
//! of the setting — it is always user-initiated — and reuses this same shared
//! entity, so a launch-time result is already visible when the window opens.
